return "Foreign mercenaries have applied to invade any country for a small fee.\n\nFor the next 3 turns, you have the option of using mercenaries in an invasion once per turn.  A mercenary invasion increases the level of your invasion by 1 (guaranteeing the invasion if you planned a full force invasion), but you must draw double rebellion cards for all principalities invaded with mercenaries.\n\nYou must continue to draw double rebellion cards, even if this card is not active, until the principality is lost."
